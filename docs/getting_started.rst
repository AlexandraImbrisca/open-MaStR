Getting started
***************

For using open-MaStR download, process or analyze utilities, you need to :ref:`install <Installation>` the package and
configure your :ref:`setup`. For downloading the Marktstammdatenregister (MaStR) raw data, additionally, a
:ref:`MaStR-account <Creating a MaStR account>` is required.

Installation
============

Setup and configuration
=======================

The directory `$HOME/.open-MaStR` is automatically created. It is used to store configuration files and save data.
Default config files are copied to this directory which can be modified - but with caution.

Credentials
-----------

Credentials for the MaStR-API are stored in `$HOME/.open-MaStR/config/credentials.cfg` (plain text).
If this file does not exist, you're asked to enter your data on the command-line.
